# CodeShare-Pr

The UX programmers face some problem while working with HTML/CSS/JS and other UX designing frameworks. The main problems are as following: -
- Writing the combined code in a single file
- Check the output on different windows on the local machine
- Hard to maintain and build on
- Hard to understand for a new user

This project is a tool where you are provided different windows to write your UX code and you can write all your different code in different windows and see the output right away.

# Technical Information

The application is designed using HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery. There is no back end as of now but there is some future work required to be done. There is no database used and the information is stored in a .csv file where user can copy and paste the code to the local machine.
